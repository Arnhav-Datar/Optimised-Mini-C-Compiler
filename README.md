# An Optimised Mini C Compiler

Done as a part of the CS3300 course at IITM
After building a Mini C-Compiler as a part of my assignment I also added several optimisations such as:
1. Simplification of if-else Blocks
2. Elimination of Unused Variables
3. Strength Reduction of Multiplication(powers of 2)
4. Constant Folding
5. Common Subexpression Elimination
6. Constant Propagation

The details regarding the same can be found in the assignment desription.
